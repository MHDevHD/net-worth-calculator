## What Is It?

It's a single HTML file that tracks your assets and liabilities. That's it. No backend, no database, no subscription fees. Just your web browser.

### Here's what it does:


Add your assets (savings, investments etc)

Add your liabilities (credit cards, student loans etc)

Watch your net worth calculate automatically

Everything is saved to the browser cache on your device

Export your data as JSON

Import it back later (or on another computer)
